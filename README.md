# Identifying and Recommending Best Restaurants

## Project Description

This project involves data analysis and visualization aimed at identifying and recommending the best restaurants. The goal is to assist a restaurant consolidator in revamping its B-to-C portal using intelligent automation technology. By leveraging Tableau and a structured approach to data analysis, this project provides insights into restaurant behaviors, helping develop effective models for recommendations.

The data analysis focuses on telling a story using the data for easy and effective communication. The project utilizes visualization techniques such as plots, charts, and tables to convey key insights beyond formal modeling or hypothesis testing.

## Problem Statement

A restaurant consolidator seeks to enhance its B-to-C portal by analyzing different matrices to identify and recommend restaurants. To achieve an effective recommendation system, it is crucial to understand the behavior of the available data.

## Approach

The project is divided into two main phases:

### 1. Data Preliminary Analysis

- **Initial Inspection**: Analyzed the data structure, identified missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistent variable names. Performed necessary cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Duplicates Handling**: Identified and removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

### 2. Preliminary Reporting

The following questions were explored and visualized using Tableau:

1. **Geographical Distribution**: Identified cities with the maximum and minimum number of restaurants.
2. **Ratings Distribution**: Explored how ratings are distributed overall.
3. **Franchise Presence**: Analyzed the franchise with the most national presence.
4. **Table Booking Analysis**: Examined the ratio of restaurants that allow table booking versus those that do not.
5. **Online Delivery Percentage**: Calculated the percentage of restaurants providing online delivery.
6. **Votes Analysis**: Investigated the difference in the number of votes between restaurants that deliver and those that do not.
7. **Top Cuisines**: Identified the top 10 cuisines served across cities.
8. **Cuisines Served and Ratings**:
   - Determined the maximum and minimum number of cuisines a restaurant serves.
   - Explored the relationship between the number of cuisines served and ratings.
9. **Cost vs Variables**: Analyzed the relationship between cost and other variables.
10. **Ratings Factors**: Explained the factors (e.g., number of cuisines, cost, delivery options) that influence ratings.
